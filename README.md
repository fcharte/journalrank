This is an ongoing project. Its goal is to automate the process of obtaining journal rankings and impact factor data.

Installation
------------

There's nothing interesting here yet, but like most "in development" R packages, `journalrank` can be installed from GitHub using:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("fcharte/journalrank")
```

Example
-------

Some usage examples will be provided once the development of the package progress.
